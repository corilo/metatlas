"alanine (U - 13C, 15N)",ISTD,POS,Alanine is only in neg mode
alanine (unlabeled),ISTD,POS,Alanine is only in neg mode
"cystine (U - 13C, 15N)",ISTD,POS,Cysteine is in the internal standard mix but we can’t detect it
cystine (unlabeled),ISTD,POS,Cysteine is in the internal standard mix but we can’t detect it
"cystine (U - 13C, 15N)",ISTD,NEG,Cysteine is in the internal standard mix but we can’t detect it
cystine (unlabeled),ISTD,NEG,Cysteine is in the internal standard mix but we can’t detect it
threonine (unlabeled),ISTD,NEG,Threonine in unlabeled neg - will have later peaks for allothreonine and homoserine use msms to pick right one
trehalose (U - 13C),ISTD,POS,Trehalose is best in neg; may be lots of isomer peaks - watch out for a peak 1 min earlier that’s not it
trehalose (unlabeled),ISTD,POS,Trehalose is best in neg; may be lots of isomer peaks - watch out for a peak 1 min earlier that’s not it
trehalose (U - 13C),ISTD,NEG,Trehalose is best in neg; may be lots of isomer peaks - watch out for a peak 1 min earlier that’s not it

"glycine (U - 13C, 15N)",ISTD,POS,"Glycine is better in neg, low intensity/spiky in pos"
glycine (unlabeled),ISTD,POS,"Glycine is better in neg, low intensity/spiky in pos"
adenine (U - 15N),ISTD,NEG,Adenine will have a lot of peaks - choose best from RT and MSMS. others are fragments of other things with adenine in them
adenine (unlabeled),ISTD,NEG,Adenine will have a lot of peaks - choose best from RT and MSMS. others are fragments of other things with adenine in them
adenine (U - 15N),ISTD,POS,Adenine will have a lot of peaks - choose best from RT and MSMS. others are fragments of other things with adenine in them

guanine (U - 15N),ISTD,POS,Labeled guanine was supposed to be in the mix but it didn't solubilize well so it's actually not there
guanine (U - 15N),ISTD,NEG,Labeled guanine was supposed to be in the mix but it didn't solubilize well so it's actually not there
